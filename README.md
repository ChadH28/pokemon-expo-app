This is a [Native.js](https://reactnative.dev/docs/) project bootstrapped with [`npm install -g expo-cli`](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/).

# Expo Router Example
Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```
npx create-expo-app@latest --my-app with-router
```
## 🚀 Addons
```
npm install 
npm install expo-font axios react-native-dotenv
```

## Getting Started

Choose a template for your app. You can choose from the options available or select a blank template.
Once your project is created, navigate to the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:

```
cd my-app
expo start

custom
npm run dev
```

This will start the Expo development server and open a web browser with the Metro Bundler, which is used to build and serve your app.

To run the app on your device, you need to download the Expo app from the App Store or Google Play Store. Once you have installed the app, open it and scan the QR code displayed in the Metro Bundler or enter the URL displayed in the terminal.

Your app should now run on your device.

Note: If you want to run your app on an iOS device, you need to have a Mac computer with Xcode installed. Similarly, if you want to run your app on an Android device, you need to have the Android SDK installed.
